""no big deal"", nothing they haven't seen or felt before --
because, after all, there's no chance for romance between
them...

otherwise. Mia tires of her heels, finds a bench and fishes
for flats in her handbag. Sebastian sits beside her as she
slips the flats on. They look at each other, suspicious...

slipped into DANCE...

other. Run back to the bench, hop atop it -- the lights
stretch out like a magic carpet. They share a moment -- share
a look -- jump off -- AND START REALLY DANCING NOW...

Mia does a move, Sebastian responds. Sebastian does a move, Mia
shakes her head: ""Nope"". They make the road their own, growing
more and more energized, as surprised as we are to find --

...that they can really dance together.

joy peeking through, our two heroes getting closer and closer
and closer, looking at each other almost giddily...

      He seems uncertain -- perhaps unsure what to play. He looks at
      Mia. Takes the sight in. Beat. Then looks at his fellow
      musicians. Murmurs to them. Then turns back to the keys --

      -- and finally starts playing.

      A quieter tune, just piano, soft and tender and melancholy. A
      melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize...

      It's Mia and Sebastian's song.

      Mia looks at Sebastian. He looks at her, then back at his keys.
      This is the most beautiful we've ever heard his playing. The
      most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded.

      We MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. We recognize this image. It
      recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT
      that night in winter, years ago. Gradually, as Sebastian
      plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER. Slowly, subtly at
      first, with just shifts in lighting, then a shift in
      perspective, the interior of the club changes, and soon...

144   ...we find ourselves back at that same RESTAURANT... Back when
      Mia laid eyes on Sebastian for the first time...

      Within this fantasy-flashback, Sebastian finishes his piece.
      We stick on Mia, watching him as his Boss talks to him. All is
      as before, as we remember it... And sure enough, Mia
      approaches Sebastian as he walks near her, and --",0.23499999999999996
MIA,"I just wanted to say -- I saw your
                playing, and I --

      -- but instead of brushing past her --

      -- Sebastian decks her with a kiss for the ages.

      A BURST OF ORCHESTRAL MUSIC. The DINERS in the restaurant spin
      around to face Mia and Sebastian -- and SNAP their fingers in
      time. Even the Boss starts to DANCE. Mia and Sebastian grin --
      and then strut out together, hand in hand... [EPILOGUE]",-0.25
MIA,"No... We should go.

      He nods. They rise from their seats and head for the exit.

      Just as they reach the door, and as David steps out, Mia turns
      and looks back at Sebastian. He looks at her. Their eyes lock.
      A hint of a tear in both...

      And, ever so subtly, for just a fleeting second, Mia smiles.

      It's the kind of smile you could miss if you blinked -- but
      it's enough to signal to Sebastian that she recognized the
      melody he played, and that she still remembers it, and still
      thinks of it to this day...

      Then she walks out the door. Sebastian glances at his fellow
      musicians. Then, he nods, and they launch into a new chart.",0.10043290043290043
