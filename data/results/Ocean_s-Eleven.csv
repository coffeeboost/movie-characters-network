                  The Nevada Gaming Commission
                  stipulates: a casino must hold in
                  reserve enough cash to cover every
                  chip at play on its floor. As I
                  mentioned, this vault services
                  each of the three casinos above
                  it. That means: during the week,
                  by law, it must hold anywhere from
                  sixty to seventy million dollars
                  in cash and coin. On a weekend,
                  between eighty and ninety million.
                  On a fight night, like the one two
                  weeks from tonight, the night
